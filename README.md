Quotes can be added or removed by adjusting the quotes array making sure that the formatting is kept the same.


Features:
This project will open a page in a webrowser and show a quote from a great thinker including their name and link to their biography.

The background of the page will change with each quote but will never change to pure white which would obscure the text.
